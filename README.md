Building and Evaluating Advanced RAG(Retrevial Augmented Generation)Framework
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response. Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast volumes of data and use billions of parameters to generate original output for tasks like answering questions, translating languages, and completing sentences. RAG extends the already powerful capabilities of LLMs to specific domains or an organization's internal knowledge base, all without the need to retrain the model. It is a cost-effective approach to improving LLM output so it remains relevant, accurate, and useful in various contexts.

How does Retrieval-Augmented Generation work?
Without RAG, the LLM takes the user input and creates a response based on information it was trained on—or what it already knows. With RAG, an information retrieval component is introduced that utilizes the user input to first pull information from a new data source. The user query and the relevant information are both given to the LLM. The LLM uses the new knowledge and its training data to create better responses. The following sections provide an overview of the process.

Create external data
The new data outside of the LLM's original training data set is called external data. It can come from multiple data sources, such as a APIs, databases, or document repositories. The data may exist in various formats like files, database records, or long-form text. Another AI technique, called embedding language models, converts data into numerical representations and stores it in a vector database. This process creates a knowledge library that the generative AI models can understand.

Retrieve relevant information
The next step is to perform a relevancy search. The user query is converted to a vector representation and matched with the vector databases. For example, consider a smart chatbot that can answer human resource questions for an organization. If an employee searches, "How much annual leave do I have?" the system will retrieve annual leave policy documents alongside the individual employee's past leave record. These specific documents will be returned because they are highly-relevant to what the employee has input. The relevancy was calculated and established using mathematical vector calculations and representations.

Augment the LLM prompt
Next, the RAG model augments the user input (or prompts) by adding the relevant retrieved data in context. This step uses prompt engineering techniques to communicate effectively with the LLM. The augmented prompt allows the large language models to generate an accurate answer to user queries.

Update external data
The next question may be—what if the external data becomes stale? To maintain current information for retrieval, asynchronously update the documents and update embedding representation of the documents. You can do this through automated real-time processes or periodic batch processing. This is a common challenge in data analytics—different data-science approaches to change management can be used.
